# ar-tag-detection-and-tracking
### This project will focus on detecting a custom AR Tag (a form offiducial marker),that is used for obtaining a point of reference in the real world, such as in
augmented reality applications. There are two aspects to using an AR Tag, namely
detection and tracking, both of which will be implemented in this project. The
detection stage will involve finding the AR Tag from a given image sequence while
the tracking stage will involve keeping the tag in “view” throughout the sequence
and performing image processing operations based on the tag’s orientation and
position (a.k.a. the pose). You are provided multiple video sequences on which you
test your code.
